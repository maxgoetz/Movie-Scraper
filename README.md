# New Movie Data Scraper
This project scrapes the website Flixster to pull data from movies that are coming out in theaters in the next week. It then updates a Google sheet with the link to the movie, the title, the Tomatometer rating, the MPA rating, the length, the release date, and the description of the movie. It is set to run once a week on Sunday evenings to give the user a look into what movies are coming up that week. It excludes movies that do not have a rating from Rotten Tomatoes.
